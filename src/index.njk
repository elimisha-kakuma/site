      <h2>Bridging the Education Gap</h2>
      <p>Kenyaâ€™s Kakuma Refugee Camp was established in 1992 with the arrival of the "Lost Boys of Sudan," who were fleeing civil war. What was meant to be a temporary refuge has become a permanent settlement of over 160,000 refugees.  In Kakuma, education offers children an escape from a difficult reality.  But more importantly, a decent education creates a pathway to opportunities for children and their families. However, as students get older, access to higher education becomes all but unattainable.</p>

        <strong>Elimisha Kakuma wants to change that.</strong>
