My name is Nyanut Maluach Kuot. I am the youngest child and the only girl in a family of 4 children. I am a South Sudanese refugee born in Tharrakoon village in the heart of South Sudan. There are times when I reflect on the memories of my hometown. Tharakoon village always had a cool, fresh breeze sweeping in and caressing peopleâ€™s faces in the morning. This village is where I lived until the age of twelve when hell broke loose. I was displaced by the war and later found myself in the Kakuma refugee camp in 2012 where I started my primary education.

I developed an early interest in leadership in grade three for I was in class with other fellow refugees from various nationalities with diverse cultures, and I was always elected as the class captain. I continued to develop my interest in leadership in high school, and I held several positions with library captain as my best position.

I love seeing change and improvement, and I love writing and taking pictures of everything.
