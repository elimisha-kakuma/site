My name is Nyanut Maluach Kuot. I am the only girl and the last born in a family of 4 children. I am a South Sudanese refugee born in Tharrakoon village in the heart of South Sudan . There are times when I reflect on the memories of my hometown. Tharakoon village always had cool fresh breeze sweeping in and caressing peopleâ€™s faces smoothly in the morning and this is where I grew up till the age of twelve when hell broke loose due communal wars that got me displaced and later found myself in the Kakuma refugee camp in 2012 where I started my primary education.

I developed an early interest in leadership in grade three for I was in class with other fellow refugees from various nationalities with diverse cultures and I was always elected as the class captain. I improved my leadership interest in high school and I held several positions with library captain as my best position.

I love seeing a change and improvement in everything and I love writing and taking snaps of everything.
