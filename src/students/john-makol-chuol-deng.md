My name is Makol Deng. I was born in South Sudan in a small village in central Bahr el Ghazal. My dad was a soldier whom I rarely saw. I was just 10 years old when he was killed. Due to domestic family problems, I lived with my grandmother for most of my early childhood. Growing up she always taught me to be industrious, committed to whatever I started, to be resilient and to always believe in myself. She always spoke with the utmost kindness. My main job was to take care of her animals in the village. After living through a war that seemed to last forever, I decided to seek refuge in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp. I arrived on January 22nd of 2012.

Kakuma refugee camp is a very challenging place to live. It is extremely hot, sanitation is very poor and we are exposed to many diseases, especially on days that it rains. Something that has inspired me is seeing that the kids here in Kakuma have a strong desire to compete nationally in academics despite the harsh environment.
In 2014, I was lucky to be sponsored by a Kenyan family friend in Eldoret. This family changed my life as they paid for the rest of my primary school fees and supported my first term in high school. Although I later got a scholarship, it was their immeasurable kindness that opened other opportunities for me. This kindness changed me completely because through them I was able to access a quality education. They are my heroes and role models for what I dream of achieving in life.

From growing up in my community, I know what it means to learn under a tree and to lack resources like books and teachers. I know what it means to be sick and not get treatment because there is no hospital, what it means to suffer from water-borne disease because of a lack of clean water. Although I have not yet figured out the best career to pursue, I’m most interested in education, environment studies, and computer science. Acquiring skills in this multidisciplinary combination of subjects will allow me to solve complex problems. Going to university means developing the skills and tools that I will use to improve people’s lives. My dream is to change the situation of my community and country at large by providing better education and opportunities to my community.
