My name is Makol Deng. I was born in South Sudan, in a small village in central Bahr el Ghazal. Both my parents were South Sudanese. My dad was a soldier whom I rarely saw. I was barely 10 years old when he was killed. Due to domestic family problems, I lived with my grandmother for most of my early childhood. Growing up she has always taught me to be industrious, committed to whatever I started, to be resilient and to always believe in myself. She always spoke with utmost kindness. My main job was to take care of her animals in the village. After what felt like forever of war, I decided to seek refuge in Kenyaâ€™s Kakuma Refugee Camp. I arrived on January 22nd of 2012.

Kakuma Refugee Camp is a very challenging place to live. It is extremely hot, sanitation is very poor and we are exposed to many diseases especially on days that it rains. Something that has inspired me is seeing the kids here in Kakuma having a strong desire to compete nationally in academics despite the harsh environment.

In 2014, I was lucky to be sponsored by a Kenyan family friend in Eldoret. This family changed my life as they paid for the rest of my primary school fees and supported my first term in high school. Although I later got a scholarship, it was their immeasurable kindness that opened other opportunities for me. This kindness changed me completely because through them I was able to access a quality education. They are my heroes and role models of what I dream to achieve in life.

Although I have not yet figured out the best career to pursue, my interests range from computer science, to pharmacy and environmental engineering. Each of these three means one thing to me: to change the situation of my community and country at large. Acquiring skills in these multidisciplinary combinations of subjects will allow me to solve complex problems. I have always dreamed of providing a better education, building health facilities, and providing clean water to my community.

Going to university means acquiring the skills and tools that I will use to change the situation in my community.

Growing up in my community, I know what it means to learn under a tree and lack resources like books and teachers. I know what it means to be sick and not get treatment because there is no hospital. What it means to suffer from water-bones disease because of lack of clean water.
