My name is Kuany Atem. I am a South Sudanese refugee living in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Kakuma has been my home all my life as I was born and grew up here in the camp. My parents fled a civil war in South Sudan during the Sudanese civil war and they arrived in the camp in 1992. My mother fled to find a safer place for her then six children but she unfortunately lost all of them to malnutrition. She came to the camp empty handed. She came to give birth to me here in the camp after years of persuasion by the elders. She named me Kuany meaning suffering but later gave me another name, Adhiei, which means blessing. She would always say I opened her eyes to the endless blessings of God.

I started schooling here in the camp and because of my good performance, an organization named Seeds of South Sudan offered to educate me in a better school outside the camp. I finished in 2018 and became a volunteer teacher at Kakuma Refugee Secondary School. I would like to pursue a degree in computer science. I believe with technology one can solve world challenges ranging from healthcare, agriculture, education, and global warming. I am passionate about bringing life changing innovations to my community in the health sector so that no more children will succumb to malnutrition and other treatable diseases.

In my free time I love reading, writing essays, and playing basketball.
