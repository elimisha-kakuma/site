My name is Grace Amer Bech. I am a South Sudanese girl living in Kakuma Refugee Camp. In the year 2007, after a series of brutal wars, my sister and I left our family in South Sudan to come to Kakuma Refugee Camp with my uncle to access education and safety. The rest of my family later resettled in Nyumanzi Refugee Resettlement Camp in Northern Uganda in the year 2014 after another civil war erupted in 2013. During my sophomore year of high school, another coup attempt happened in South Sudan, which caused massive loss of lives, properties, and other essential valuables. I had to drop out of school since my uncle was left bankrupt in the aftermath. With my inborn grit, I managed to overcome this challenge and pursued my education. I sought help from friends who had similar problems and I was able to attend school through sports. I got a football scholarship, through which I managed to graduate from high school with good grades. My resilience and determination have always been evident throughout my academic journey.

Being the second born and away from my family, I have learned independence and self-drive through taking care of her younger siblings and later my cousins. The help that I have received throughout my academic journey has inspired me to be a community person. I am awed by the works the United Nations has done and continues to do for refugees worldwide. My admiration has led me to have a long list of volunteer activities, such as teaching in both Kakuma Refugee Camp and Nyumanzi Refugee Resettlement Camp, working in the clinic as a translator and attendee, and volunteering at church service and through community cleaning. In all aspects of life I always strive to make a change.

I am currently undecided about the exact career to pursue in college, but am interested in health, international relations, and global studies. I love reading novels, chatting with friends, playing volleyball, and swimming.
