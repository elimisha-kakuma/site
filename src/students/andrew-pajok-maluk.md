My name is Andrew Pajok Maluk, and I am the second born of seven children. Iâ€™m South Sudanese by nationality. I made it to Kakuma Refugee camp in February 2006 after my father had come here for medication and met my uncle who had fled to Kakuma during the Bor Massacre in 1991.

During the repatriation we went to Nakuru where I did my academics till class seven, but my uncle could not meet all the needs required so we returned to Kakuma.The same year my elder sister got married and her husband took me to a boarding school till my graduation.

My passion is to be a software engineer and advance my knowledge in developing a humanoid robot. I was inspired by Hanson company in Hong Kong when they developed Sofia. Being in a developing country and being a refugee creates many barriers to accessing higher education, which present challenges that could obstruct my dream. I love playing basketball and football and listening to music in my free time.
