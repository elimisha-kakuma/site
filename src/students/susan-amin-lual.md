My name is Susan Amin Lual. I am a South Sudanese by nationality. When war broke out in 2013, we eventually fled to Kakuma Refugee Camp in 2014 for safety and education. I am a second born in a family of 12. I teach as a volunteer over the holiday to primary school students who might need help in anything. My mother inspires me because even in the face of adversities, she stays strong and bold. Even though she is illiterate, she works herself tirelessly to make sure we go to school. With her concerned nature, it encourages my sisters and I to grow personally and academically. Throughout my education I have had my own ups and downs, because my society does not allow girls to be educated, but I did not give up on schooling. I would like to study Public Health, because I want many people in South Sudan who are neglected to be paid attention to. There are many diseases which are affecting and killing people in South Sudan and because of this, more hospitals and medicines are needed. I am passionate about helping the sick people in my home country of South Sudan. Most of them are not aware of certain diseases that are affecting them and they need to be educated on this. My hobbies are reading novels, travelling, and listening to music.
