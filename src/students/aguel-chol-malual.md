My name is Aguel Chol Malual. I was born in Kakuma Refugee Camp, but my family is from South Sudan. I am the second oldest in a family of six children and currently live with my mom, as I lost my dad some years back. I am passionate about helping people because I was lucky to have my uncles who helped us out, and so I would like to do the same for others. I would like to study Radiology as there are few people in this field that can help my community back in South Sudan. I am really inspired by BTS, the K-pop band, because they are really hard working and make me believe that through hard work I can achieve my set goals. My hobbies are singing, dancing, and travelling.
