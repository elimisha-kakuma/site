Abdirizak Aden Mohamed is the sixth born of 12 children. He was born in Ethiopia where he lived until nine. His family lived in a rural area of the Warder region in Ethiopia where they reared small livestock.

One night, he was forced to flee his home country when a war between the government of Ethiopia and the so-called ONLF group suddenly broke out. Every member of his family had to flee for his/her life, for there was no time to plan or regroup to escape. There is no information up to date about the livestock, perhaps they were taken by either group. After some days of looking for each other, the family was able to reunite.
