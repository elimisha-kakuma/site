Abdirizak Aden Mohamed is the sixth born of 12 children. He was born in Ethiopia where he lived until nine. His family lived in a rural area of the Warder region in Ethiopia where they reared small livestock. One night, he was forced to flee his home country when a war between the government of Ethiopia and the so-called ONLF group suddenly broke out. Every member of his family had to flee for his/her life, for there was no time to plan or regroup to escape. There is no information up to date about the livestock, perhaps they were taken by either group. After some days of looking for each other, the family was able to reunite.

They started their journey for a better life which led them to Dadaab Refugee Camp and later resettled to Kakuma Refugee Camp by the UNHCR, The United Nations High Commission for Refugees. He enrolled in Somali Bantu Primary School, and then to newly built Lokitaung primary school. He later went to Vision Secondary School within Kakuma. He has been in Kakuma for twelve years. During that time, he volunteered teaching at Vision secondary school, then in Greenlight Secondary School before he was accepted into Elimisha Kakuma. Aden hopes to pursue Computer and Electrical Engineering to promote the lives of his people by bringing technology to the region. His hobbies are reading books of wisdom, listening to the Quran, and playing football.
