I am the sixth-born child in my family of 12 children. I was born in Ethiopia where I lived until the age of nine. My family lived in a rural area of the Warder region in Ethiopia where we reared small livestock. I was forced to flee my home country when a war between the government of Ethiopia and the ONLF group suddenly broke out. There was no time to plan an escape, and every member of my family had to flee for their lives. After days of looking for each other, my family was finally able to reunite.

We started our journey for a better life, which led us to Dadaab Refugee Camp. We were later resettled in Kakuma Refugee Camp by the UNHCR, The United Nations High Commission for Refugees. I enrolled in Somali Bantu primary school, and then later in the newly built Lokitaung primary school. I later went to Vision Secondary School within Kakuma. I have been living in Kakuma for twelve years. After finishing secondary school, I was a volunteer teacher at Vision and Greenlight secondary schools before I was accepted into Elimisha Kakuma. I hope to pursue a degree in computer and electrical engineering to improve the lives of my people by bringing technology to my home region. My hobbies are reading books of wisdom, listening to the Quran, and playing football.
