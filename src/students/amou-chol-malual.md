My name is Amou Chol. I am the first born in a family of six children made up of three girls and three boys. I am South Sudanese by nationality, but I have never been there. I was born in Kakuma Refugee Camp. My parents fled from the war in South Sudan back in 1991. They walked long journeys before arriving in Kakuma. WHen they arrived, they were barefoot, having survived extreme temperatures walking across the desert, hungry, cold, and tired. I am currently volunteering as a teacher at Kakuma Refugee secondary school. I lost my father in 2018, which took a toll on me emotionally and financially. My studies were threatened, but my uncle came in and helped my family. I am passionate about humanity and hope to see it thrive everyday. My hobbies are playing basketball and reading.
