I’m Samuel Hatungimana, the first born in a family of three children. I have been living with my mother and two siblings in Kakuma refugee camp since 2013. My father couldn’t make this journey following the Rwandan Genocide (1994) that affected my family on the northern region of Burundi where my father was killed. Amidst the general struggles of being a refugee, lack of access to quality education, struggle to meet daily needs, lack of resources and people to invest in us, I aspire everyday to be the best version of myself. During the holidays, in the midst of the Corona pandemic, I managed to engage in various kinds of work, such as digging latrine holes and working in “Bodaboda.” Finally, I was able to buy a sewing machine for my mother.

My interests are in arts ( fashion, film, photography and coaching design) alongside computer science. They both intersect for me, in a sense for art to thrive, technology, coded programs that allow advancement for art is dire. My hope is to be able to attend college, to better serve my community, build and repair a country from which I was forced to flee to gain an identity lost.
