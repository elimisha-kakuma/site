My name's Achuil Akol Kueth from South Sudan and the civil war forced me to seek asylum as a refugee in Kenya. I have been in Kakuma for 9 years where I completed my primary and secondary education.

I was the third born child in my family of four siblings, and we lived with my parents in South Sudan. Due to the very long civil war in Sudan, I lost my parents and my siblings. For now, I may say I'm living with my cousins, and luckily the UN became my second parents, who can give me food and shelter.

Since I completed high school, I have volunteered and delivered my services to the community by teaching my fellow students, participating in community works, and running small businesses to cater for my needs as well.

My hobbies are swimming, travelling, and reading as well. I would like to pursue civil engineering as a career because I have passion for designing infrastructure and constructing buildings. With courage and confidence, I believe I have the will to keep my dreams alive.

We are here to give back to our people, and I believe one day I will come up with a design that would contribute to the infrastructure in South Sudan.
