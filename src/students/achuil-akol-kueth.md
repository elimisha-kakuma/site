My name's Achuil Akol Kueth. I am from South Sudan, but I have been in the Kakuma refugee camp for 10 years now, following the civil war in my home country. I was the third-born child in my family of four siblings, and we lived with my parents in South Sudan. Due to the very long civil war in Sudan, I lost my parents and my siblings. For now, I'm living with my cousins, and luckily the UN became my second parents who can give me food and shelter. It was in Kakuma that I completed my primary and secondary education.

Since I completed high school, I have volunteered and delivered my services to the community by teaching my fellow students, participating in community work, and running small businesses. My hobbies are swimming, traveling, and reading.

I would like to pursue civil engineering as a career because I have passion for designing infrastructure and constructing buildings. With courage and confidence, I believe I have the will to keep my dreams alive. We are here to give back to our people, and I believe one day I will come up with a design that will contribute to the infrastructure in South Sudan.
