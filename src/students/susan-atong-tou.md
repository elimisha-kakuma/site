My name is Susan Atong Tou, preferred to be called Atong. A south sudanese born and raised in a refugee camp based in Kenya.A second in a family of four.

It happens that my family had flew out of the country during the civil war in 1991, until they found themselves in the camp it was a whole roll acoster which involved death, injuries escapee.Fortunately they were among the escapes.

Having been raised in kakuma ,things were so tough until when fortunately we moved to the city in Nairobi following a scholarship I had gotten .My mum decided to also take my other siblings also she felt that it was not safe for her kids to be out there 'alone in the foreign land' as she called it.This was when I was in class five.

I completed both my primary and high school and primary successfully.All this time I had a passion for cooking so I wanted to make it professional.Fortunately I traced a friend of my mum who had once given her a scholarship so I reached out to her and at that time I was lucky enough to get one . Obviously I had to choose a catering course to perfect the art. It was a six months course that really changed my perspective of how people view culinary arts.

Apart from the passion I have for culinary arts .I am also into sports Volleyball, soccer mostly.I believe in handcrafts i.e knitting,crotchets.
