My name is Susan Atong Tou, but I prefer to be called Atong. I am South Sudanese, but I was born and raised in Kakuma refugee camp based in Kenya, the second in a family of four.

My family fled South Sudan during the civil war in 1991 and later found themselves in the camp. It was a whole rollercoaster, which involved injuries and death, but fortunately they were able to escape.

Having been raised in Kakuma, life was tough until fortunately we moved to Nairobi following a scholarship I had received. My mum decided to also take my other siblings as she felt that it was not safe for her kids to be out there 'alone in the foreign land' as she called it. This was when I was in class five.

I completed both my primary and high school successfully. During this time, I developed a passion for cooking, and I wanted to do it professionally. Fortunately I traced a friend of my mum who had once given her a scholarship, so I reached out to her and at that time I was lucky enough to get one. Obviously I had to choose a catering course to perfect the art. It was a six-month course that really changed my perspective of how people view culinary arts.

Apart from the passion I have for the culinary arts. I also enjoy sports such as volleyball and soccer and enjoy making handcrafts.
