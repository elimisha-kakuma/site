  <h1>Kakuma Refugee Camp</h1>
  <p>
    Kenya’s Kakuma Refugee Camp was established in 1992 with the arrival of the
    “Lost Boys of Sudan,” who were fleeing civil war. What was meant to be a
    temporary refuge has become a permanent settlement of over 160,000 refugees.
    In Kakuma, education offers children an escape from a difficult reality. But
    more importantly, a decent education creates a pathway to opportunities for
    children and their families. However, as students get older, access to
    higher education becomes all but unattainable. According to a 2017 UNHCR
    Report, only three percent of refugees worldwide, and only one percent of
    refugees in East Africa, make it to college or university.

    Children face numerous obstacles when pursuing education, including poverty
    and harsh weather conditions; a lack of trained teachers, textbooks, and
    materials; and a lack of basic needs such as food and water. In addition to
    those challenges, girls must clean, cook, wash, collect water, and take care
    of younger family members all while facing social and family pressure to
    marry young and/or drop out of school. Those who manage to overcome these
    obstacles and finish secondary school face a dead end, without access to
    higher education, despite having the talent. While some organizations offer
    support, many high-achieving students in Kakuma lack the technology, money,
    and information necessary to access college.
