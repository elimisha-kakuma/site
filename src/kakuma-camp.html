  <h1>Kakuma Refugee Camp</h1>
  <p style="--font-size: var(--s1)">
    Kenyaâ€™s Kakuma Refugee Camp was established in 1992 with the arrival of the
    "Lost Boys of Sudan," who were fleeing civil war. What was meant to be a
    temporary refuge has become a permanent settlement of over 160,000 refugees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kakuma is located in the far northwest
    corner of Kenya, between Lake Turkana, South Sudan, and Uganda. The climate
    is hot and dry, suitable more for herding goats and camels than agriculture.
    A <span class="font-style:italic">laaga</span> (dry river bed) cuts through
    the camp but becomes impassable, and dangerous, when rain comes to the
    mountains at its source far away. Water for drinking and cleaning comes
    either from pits dug in the laaga or from unreliable and overcrowded pumps
    that operate only twice a day for an hour and a half.

    Established as a temporary humanitarian solution for a few thousand "Lost
    Boys" of Sudan in 1992, it has now existed for three decades and houses over
    180,000 people representing over 20 nationalities from east and central
    Africa - although many were born in the camp, and it is the only home they
    have known. Even if a refugee is born in Kakuma, even if their parents were
    born in Kakuma, that refugee cannot claim Kenyan citizenship; legally, they
    are a citizen of the country from which their ancestors fled, a country they
    have never seen. Refugees are not free to travel elsewhere in Kenya without
    government permission, and risk arrest, abuse, and demands for bribes if
    found outside the camp.
  </p>

    Although the Kakuma Refugee Camp has over the years provided a safe haven
    for people fleeing violence, for many residents it has become a 'voluntary
    prison.' In exchange for relative safety, they have agreed to be interned in
    Kakuma with no release date. Returning to their countries of citizenship
    might mean risking their lives, they have no right to create new lives
    elsewhere in Kenya, and precious few are approved for resettlement in the
    US, Canada, or Europe. Governments and NGOs treat them as if they are good
    for whom there is no buyer: dropped in a warehouse and forgotten.
  </p>

    In Kakuma, education offers children an escape from a difficult reality. But
    more importantly, a decent education creates a pathway to opportunities for
    children and their families. However, as students get older, access to
    higher education becomes all but unattainable. According to a 2017 UNHCR
    Report, only three percent of refugees worldwide, and only one percent of
    refugees in East Africa, make it to college or university.
  </p>
  <p>
    Children face numerous obstacles when pursuing education, including poverty
    and harsh weather conditions; a lack of trained teachers, textbooks, and
    materials; overcrowded schools-with class sizes over 100; and a lack of
    basic needs such as food and water. In addition to those challenges, girls
    must clean, cook, wash, collect water, and take care of younger family
    members all while facing social and family pressure to marry young and/or
    drop out of school. Those who manage to overcome these obstacles and finish
    secondary school face a dead end, without access to higher education,
    despite having the passion and talent to continue. While some organizations
    offer support, many high-achieving students in Kakuma lack the technology,
    money, and information necessary to access college, hence the creation of
    Elimisha Kakuma.
