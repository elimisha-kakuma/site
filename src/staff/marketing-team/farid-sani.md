I am a double Major in Quantitative Economics and theater with an emphasis in Math. I am a proficient user of Microsoft Excel, Word and PowerPoint, G-suite, R and Python.

I have spent the last 3 year of the COVID-19 induced lockdown full time with Guaranty trust banks as a data/marketing intern and with Premium polo feeds as a quality control analyst/ proximate analysis technician. I have gained significant experience in working with data, computing numbers and gathering analytical experience in the human banking sector as well as the animal feed industry. My experience at Saint Olaf college as A DISCO (Digital Scholarship center Intern) has given me the prerequisite, Audio technology, media communications and team skills I believe can contribute immensely in my next work environment. I have an exemplary work ethic and promise to diligently execute any tasks given to me. I have served my college, St. Olaf for 2 years as a and varsity soccer team player and have led my home town Polo team as team captain . My long term goal is to further my education in Grad school within the next five years and continue to build on my professional career. In the meantime, my short term goal is to find a competitive, honest, work-driven team to further myself as I grow.

I currently work with Ovative Groups in Downtown Minneapolis.
