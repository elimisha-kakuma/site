Maha Shoaib is a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Clinical Neuroscience and minoring in Religion. She hopes to become a physician to work with underserved populations and give back to various communities. Being someone actively combating current-day issues, Maha began volunteering for the Blacksburg Refugee Partnership to resettle Afghan refugees in Blacksburg upon the fall of Kabul. Such an opportunity led Maha to discover her love for working with refugees through formulating friendships and developing a community. In the future, she hopes to continue working with refugee and displaced populations, where she can combine the skills she learns working with Elimisha Kakuma with her future career to combat health disparities that still prevail worldwide.
